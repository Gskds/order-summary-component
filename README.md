## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

box-shadow takes 5 valus. The 1st value controls the horizontal offset, the 2nd controls vertical offset, the 3rd controls blur & the 4th controls color and there is optional 5th value which controles the spread of the blur.
The 1st 4 valus are mandatory to set them unless otherwise it won't work. The two offset (i.e horizontal and vertical) controle the placement of the shadow. The blur control the length of the blur.

I understand hsl value unit i.e hsl(unit less, %, %,) and order also matters. e.g hsl(230, 40%, 20%) is correct while hsl(20%, 300, 40%) is wrong.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
